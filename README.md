# Cruise0 React SDK POC

This sample demonstrates the integration of [Auth0 React SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react) into a React application created using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). The sample is a companion to the [Auth0 React SDK Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react).

This sample demonstrates the following use cases:

- [Login](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/components/NavBar.js#L72-L79)
- [Logout](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/components/NavBar.js#L102-L108)
- [Showing the user profile](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/views/Profile.js)
- [Protecting routes](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/views/Profile.js#L33)
- [Calling APIs](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/blob/master/Sample-01/src/views/ExternalApi.js)

## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Create an API

For the ["call an API"](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/02-calling-an-api) page to work, you will need to [create an API](https://auth0.com/docs/apis) using the [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis). This will give you an API identifier that you can use in the `audience` configuration field below.

If you do not wish to use an API or observe the API call working, you should not specify the `audience` value in the next step. Otherwise, you will receive a "Service not found" error when trying to authenticate.

### Configure credentials

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 domain and client ID in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `src/auth_config.json.example` into a new file in the same folder called `src/auth_config.json`, and replace the values with your own Auth0 application credentials, and optionally the base URLs of your application and API:

```json
{
  "domain": "{YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN}",
  "clientId": "{YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID}",
  "audience": "{YOUR AUTH0 API_IDENTIFIER}",
  "appOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR APPLICATION (default: http://localhost:3000)}",
  "apiOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR API (default: http://localhost:3001)}"
}
```

**Note**: Do not specify a value for `audience` here if you do not wish to use the API part of the sample.

### Starting the application
Run `npm start` to initiate and run the application

## Navigating the application
The app consists of four routes plus the Auth0 application. 
Access to each component depends on the authentication status of your current user.

General workflow:
User arrives at landing page.
User clicks log in and is redirected to Auth0 application .
Once a verfied user successfully logs in, you will be redirected to the landing page with access to two new pages: External API and Profile.
If a non-verified user attempts to log in, you will be redirected to the Unauth0rized page prompting you to verify your email address.

Profile page display user profile information that is currently stored in Auth0 or is the current context of the logged in user.
External API, if set up with audience, will attempt to ping an API and return a message displaying whether your access token was accepted.

## Frequently Asked Questions

If you're having issues running the sample applications, including issues such as users not being authenticated on page refresh, please [check the auth0-react FAQ](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react/blob/master/FAQ.md).

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).

## Create a Free Auth0 Account
